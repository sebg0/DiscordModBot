# Instructions

1. Copy and paste your bot token and mongoDB path into the config.json file
2. Change the prefix if you want
3. Run **npm install** in your terminal (make sure you have nodejs installed before doing this)
4. Start the bot using **node index.js**

# Information
- I did not make the event or command handlers, they are ones I found online and like to use in all my projects
- If there's a problem with the code please let me know so I can fix it (discord: seb.go#2641)
- You have to host this either on your computer or using a hosting service such as [Skysilk](https://www.skysilk.com/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- This bot client is not meant to be added in more than one server. Doing so will only cause errors.
